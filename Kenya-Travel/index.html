                                    Kenya is a <strong>multilingual country</strong>. Although the official languages are <strong>Swahili and English</strong>, there are actually a total of 62 languages spoken in the country (according to Ethnologue). 
                                    These mainly consist of tribal African languages as well as a minority of Middle-Eastern and Asian languages spoken by descendants of foreign settlers (i.e. Arabic, Hindi, etc). 
                                    The African languages come from three different language families - Bant Languages (spoken in the center and southeast), Nilotic languages (in the west), and Cushitic languages (in the northeast).
                                    Make Kenya the excuse for your next cultural tour destination. Kenya is home to 42 different, unique cultures. Also inhabited by Europeans, Asians, Indians and nationalities from different parts of the world, the different cultures that have come together in Kenya form our identity.

                                             This undertaking has necessitated a fence - to keep out poachers rather than to restrict the movement of wildlife

                                                Bike through the escapades of Mount Longonot or better yet climb the rocks of Hells Gate? Look no farther. 
                                                Away from the vast savannah grasslands, Kenyaâ€™s amazing landscapes especially on the Rift Valley and Central Kenya are riddled with adventure trails unlike foreign spots where one would need an airport transfer service from Alicante to Benidorm to move around, for instance.

                                                For absolute exhilaration, the simple idea of being on or inside water is unbeatable away from a busy career life where fast food near me spots are everything.
                                                For a wide variety of water sports the Kenyaâ€™s wild rivers, lakes and the expansive Indian Ocean offer you the perfect opportunity for both motorized and non-motorized water sports and under water activities you could dive into.

                                                Kenya is home to 42 different, unique cultures. Also inhabited by Europeans, Asians, Indians and nationalities from different parts of the world, the different cultures that have come together in Kenya form our identity.
                                                 You could choose to stay in the villages and experience untainted traditional ways of life or experience urban culture in Kenyaâ€™s cities, 
                                                 where the fast life is never fast enough.
